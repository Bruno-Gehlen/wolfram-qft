## Exploring Particle Physics and Quantum Field Theory with Mathematica

This repository contains Wolfram Mathematica code developed during a research project on Particle Physics and Quantum Field Theory. The main goal is to provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience with advanced physics concepts, complementing traditional study with the creation of programs that perform relevant calculations and simulations.

**Repository Contents:**

* **Mathematica Programs:** Notebooks containing code for calculations, simulations, and demonstrations of key concepts in Particle Physics and Quantum Field Theory.
* **Documentation:** Detailed descriptions of each program, including usage instructions, explanations of the physical concepts addressed, and application examples.
* **Additional Resources:** Links to supporting materials such as books, articles, and presentations that complement learning.

**Examples of Programs:**

* Calculation of cross sections for particle scattering.
* Simulation of particle propagation in different fields.
* Visualization of Feynman diagrams.
* Calculation of path integrals.

**How to Use this Repository:**

1. **Download Wolfram Mathematica:** Make sure you have the software installed on your computer.
2. **Clone the repository:** Use the `git clone` command to download the files to your local machine.
3. **Explore the notebooks:** Open the `.nb` files in Mathematica and run the code.
